MySQL vs NoSQL

MySQL:

data is called "tables"

It has relations (Relational Database)
OracleDB
MariaDB
MySQL
PostgreSQL
MsSQL
CouchDB

What does relation mean?

NoSQL:

Collection = Array of object
Document = Object

dynamoDB
MongoDB
Firebase
Neo4J
Realm

Is scaleable

// MongoDB usecases

Do use:

- Not sure about the schema yet
    - Leads to rapid prototyping
        - Type of companies: start-ups

Don't use:

- Easy to fuck things up

- Data is consistent og relational

- Data that is crucial and you don't trust the input you get too

- Data that is crucial, you have to be careful

More info:
    MongoDB you handle realtions, datavalidations etc in the appliocation layer
    For relational database you can also do it in the application layer but the database is another safety net
